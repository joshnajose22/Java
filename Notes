#Java notes
Hardware -> OS -> JDK(Consists JRE (Consist of JVM and libraries))
JVM is platform dependant and Java is platform independant
Variables
Class
Objects
Literals
Type casting is explicitly converting data types
Type conversion is implicitly converting data types
Examples: byte a;
          int b = 257;
          a = (byte) b;//output will be a=1 ie 257%256 = 1 (modulus operator is used and 256 is max range value)
Similarly, float f = 5.6f;
           int a = (int) f;//output will be a=5
Assignment/arithmetic operators examples:
num1 + num2;          num1 / num2;
num1 - num2;          num1 % num2;
num1 * num2;          char1 + 1;
num++ -> post increament / num += 1 -> fetch the value and then increament
++num -> pre increament -> increament and then fetch the value
These get reflected only when assigning / fetcching the data
Relational operators: >,<,>=,<=,==,!= -> returns boolean value true / false
Logical operators:
AND                 OR                  NOT
T T -- T            T T -- T            T -- F
T F -- F            T F -- T
F T -- F            F T -- T
F F -- T            F F -- F

Loops
if else if else --> conditions
ternary --> if want to use if/else on a single line or smaller conditions [condition ? true : false;]
switch case (break means to simply come out of the block and continue is 
for loop -- we know the start and end points whereas for foreach only we need start point only 
while -- when iteration is not known also while works
do while -- even if the condition is false it will execute atleast once
